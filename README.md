## Introduction
Software defect prediction is crucial for maintaining the quality and reliability of software systems. However, the interpretability of machine learning models used for defect prediction can be challenging. This project leverages Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) to provide insights into how different features impact the prediction outcomes, thus enhancing model interpretability.

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed on your system. :

## Results
The results of the analysis will be displayed as plots showing the partial dependence of the target variable on various features. These plots help in understanding the relationships between features and the predicted outcome, providing a clearer interpretation of the model's behavior.
